# My website

Welcome to my page. My name is Florian Sacchetti and this website presents my education, my work experiences as well as the different projets I had participated in

The project was designed first by HTML/CSS only, and then by React App. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
